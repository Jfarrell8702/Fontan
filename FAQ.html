  <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
  <h2> What is a Fontan procedure?</h2>
  <p>
      - The Fontan procedure is a type of heart surgery used to treat complex congenital heart defects that affect the flow of blood through the heart. <br>It's typically the third surgery in a series for children born with single-ventricle defects.
  </p>
<h2>Who needs a Fontan procedure?</h2>    
      <p>- This surgery is recommended for children who have heart defects that prevent their heart from pumping blood normally to the lungs or body. <br>It's often a part of the treatment plan for conditions like hypoplastic left heart syndrome or tricuspid atresia.</p>

  <h2>What are the goals of the Fontan procedure?</h2>  
     <p> - The main goal is to direct blood flow from the lower body directly to the lungs, bypassing the heart. <br> This improves oxygenation and reduce strain on the heart.</p>

   <h2>What are the risks of the Fontan procedure?</h2> 
      <p>- Like all surgeries, the Fontan procedure carries risks such as infection, bleeding, arrhythmias, and fluid build-up. <br>Long-term complications can include protein-losing enteropathy, liver problems, and decreased exercise capacity.</p>

    <h2>How do I prepare my child for a Fontan procedure?</h2>
     <p> - Preparation involves several pre-operative tests, discussions with your child's surgical team, and understanding the procedure and its recovery. <br>Emotional support for your child is also crucial.</p>

   <h2>What can be expected during recovery from a Fontan procedure?</h2> 
     <p> - Recovery includes a stay in the ICU and hospital to monitor the child's condition and manage pain. <br> The complete recovery at home can take several weeks, during which activities are limited, and follow-up visits are necessary. </p>

   <h2>How does the Fontan procedure affect long-term health?</h2> 
  <p>
      - Many children lead relatively normal lives post-surgery but may have some restrictions on physical activity. <br> Regular follow-up appointments with a cardiologist are essential to manage health and detect any potential issues early.
