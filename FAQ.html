      <h2> What is a Fontan procedure?</h2>
      <p>
        - The Fontan procedure is a type of heart surgery used to treat complex congenital heart defects that affect the
        flow of blood through the heart. It's typically the third surgery in a series for children born with
        single-ventricle defects.
      </p>
      <h2>Who needs a Fontan procedure?</h2>
      <p>- This surgery is recommended for children who have heart defects that prevent their heart from pumping blood
        normally to the lungs or body. It's often a part of the treatment plan for conditions like hypoplastic left
        heart syndrome or tricuspid atresia.</p>

      <h2>What are the goals of the Fontan procedure?</h2>
      <p> - The main goal is to direct blood flow from the lower body directly to the lungs, bypassing the heart. This
        improves oxygenation and reduce strain on the heart.</p>

      <h2>What are the risks of the Fontan procedure?</h2>
      <p>- Like all surgeries, the Fontan procedure carries risks such as infection, bleeding, arrhythmias, and fluid
        build-up. Long-term complications can include protein-losing enteropathy, liver problems, and decreased
        exercise
        capacity.</p>

      <h2>How do I prepare my child for a Fontan procedure?</h2>
      <p> - Preparation involves several pre-operative tests, discussions with your child's surgical team, and
        understanding
        the procedure and its recovery. Emotional support for your child is also crucial.</p>

      <h2>What can be expected during recovery from a Fontan procedure?</h2>
      <p> - Recovery includes a stay in the ICU and hospital to monitor the child's condition and manage pain. The
        complete recovery at home can take several weeks, during which activities are limited, and follow-up visits are
        necessary. </p>

      <h2>How does the Fontan procedure affect long-term health?</h2>
      <p>
        - Many children lead relatively normal lives post-surgery but may have some restrictions on physical activity.
        Regular follow-up appointments with a cardiologist are essential to manage health and detect any potential
        issues
        early.
